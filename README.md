CE-1.07-spell-check
===================

A community effort to spell check the FTL Captain's Edition mod for the roguelike game FTL by Subset Games.




House rules:

1. Changes you make in the files have the potentiall to make the mod unplayable very easily. 
Act responsible and observe this rules, else this effort to spell check CE will not work.

2. Only spell check things within text tags. Everything else might mess up the mod structure.

3. If you rephrase things, do not exeed the number of characters the text originally had, 
specially when the text was allready pretty long. Too long texts can cause the game to crash on text load.

4. Don't add intent or any kinds of breaks in the text. FTL event texts need to be pure flowtext to work correctly.

5. Never write anything outside of text tags. Stray characters outside of tags cause problems and are hard to locate afterwards.

6. Please never make any direct changes in the choices that let the player us the combat augments. 
That will remove my ability to controll these choices globablly via find and replace. 
If you have suggestions how these choices could be improved, you can make a suggestion in the thread.

7. This repository is for spellchecking, not for sneaking changes you like to see into CE. The mod is free to use for anyone.
If you have your own vision how of it should be than you can simply take a copy, make your modifications and post it.
Here is not the place for this though




Thank you all for your help
